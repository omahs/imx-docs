The exchange functionality is available in SDK v1.3.33+ and is a collaboration between Immutable X and Moonpay. `cryptoCurrencies` param is available in SDK v1.3.38+

The exchange process allows users to buy crypto from the Immutable X platform using a credit card. There's no gas price for purchases, only a [Moonpay transaction fee](https://support.moonpay.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360011930117-What-fees-do-you-charge-).

The deposit happens directly on L2 via the transfer from Moonpay accounts.

The amount, fee and currency are selected within the Moonpay widget, and are under user's control.
