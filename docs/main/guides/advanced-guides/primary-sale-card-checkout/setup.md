# Set up required endpoints

:::caution Feature for managed partners only
This is a feature intended for managed partners. If you are not a managed partner and would like to become one, please reach out to us on our [#dev-discussion channel](https://discord.gg/7URHuYFCN4) on Discord. 

If you are a managed partner, your partner success manager needs to set up a commercial partnership with MoonPay for you. Please reach out to them to facilitate this.
:::

In order to [implement](./implement.md) this NFT primary sale card checkout feature, you need to complete the following:
1. Establish a commercial partnership with MoonPay (your partner success manager will facilitate this for you)
2. [Set up and register with ImmutableX with the required endpoints](#how-to-set-up-and-register-endpoints)

## How to set up and register endpoints

### 1. Create endpoints 

You are required to provide the following endpoints:

1. [Trigger the mint](#triggering-the-mint-endpoint): An endpoint to mint the asset once payment has been confirmed with MoonPay
2. [Get asset info](#get-asset-info-endpoint): An endpoint to get information about the minted asset and render the checkout

### Triggering the mint endpoint

#### Headers required:

| Name                                                                                                           | Description                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IMX-Signature` - [How to validate this](#3-how-to-validate-the-imx-signature)                                 | Signature to confirm that the request was made by ImmutableX |
| `IMX-Timestamp` - [How to generate this](../../../key-concepts/deep-dive-api-concepts.md#imx-timestamp-string) | Timestamp header to validate `IMX-Signature`                 |

#### Request body:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `offer_id` | String | The ID of the offer provided for the NFT to be minted |
| `contract_address` | String | Smart contract address of the NFT |
| `user` | String | User that the NFT will be minted for (will become the NFT's owner) |
| `wallet_address` | String | Wallet address that will receive the payment, in crypto (from MoonPay), for the minted NFT |
| `external_transaction_id` | String (UUID) | Unique ImmutableX transaction ID that can be used to get information about the transaction |

#### Response:

| Property | Type | Descrtiption |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contract_address` | String | Smart contract address of the NFT |
| `token_id` | String | Token ID (as specified by the NFT smart contract) of the minted asset |
| `tx_id` | Integer | Minting transaction ID - see [mintTokens](/reference#/operations/mintTokens) response |

#### Example:

```shell
Request: POST /mint
headers: {
  "IMX-Signature": "5257a869e7ecebeda32affa62cdca3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff536d0ce8e108d8bd",

}

Status: 200
Response: {
  "contract_address": "string",
  "token_id": "string",
  "tx_id": 0
}
```

:::info Error on mint
If minting fails, please provide a response with the error code and message.

```shell
Response: {
 "code": "number", // the error code
 "message": "string", // the error message
 "details": "string" // the error details
}
```
:::

### Get asset info endpoint

This endpoint will be used to get information about the asset to be minted using [trigger mint endpoint](#triggering-the-mint-endpoint).

#### Response:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `offer_id` | String | The ID of the offer provided for the NFT to be minted |
| `contract_address` | String | Smart contract address of the NFT |

| `image_url` | String | URL where the image to be displayed for the minted asset is hosted |
| `price_currency_code` | String | Currency of the amount to be paid. Choose from: `"ETH"` or `"USDC"` |
| `price` | String | Amount of the currency required to mint the token |
| `seller_address` | String |  Wallet address that will receive the payment, in crypto (from MoonPay), for the minted NFT |

#### Example:

```shell
Example Request: GET /:contract_address/:offer_id

Status: 200
Response: {
 "offer_id": "123",
 "contract_address": "0xacb3...",
 "name": "SiShinylver Card Pack",
 "collection": "Gods Unchained",

:::info Unavailable offer
If an offer is unavailable, a response should return `404 - Not Found`.
```
Status: 404
Response: {
 "code": "404", // the error code
 "message": "Missing offer", // the error message
 "details": "The offer id {offer_id} is not a valid offer for purchase" // the error details
}
```

### 2. Register with ImmutableX using created endpoints

When you've set up the endpoints required in the previous step, please register with ImmutableX using the [registerNftPrimarySalesContract](https://docs.x.immutable.com/reference/#/operations/registerNftPrimarySalesContract) API endpoint.

After registration, ImmutableX will send you a webhook key that will be used to validate the signature when initiating mint requests.

### 3. How to validate the `IMX-Signature`

Generate a `signed_payload` by concatenating the following:
* `IMX-Timestamp` header
* The character `.`
* JSON payload of the message to be signed

Example:
```ts
const payload = JSON.stringify({
    "offer_id": "1",
    "contract_address": '0x23a...',
    "user": '0x8b1...',
    "wallet_address": '0x11a...',
    "external_transaction_id": "00000000-0000-0000-aaaa-0000a000aa00",
    });
    
const signed_payload = imx_timestamp_header_value + "." + payload;

```

You will then need to compute an HMAC with the SHA-256 hash function using the webhook key that we provided when you [registered the endpoints with ImmutableX](#2-register-with-immutablex-using-created-endpoints) for the `signed_payload` and use it to compare the signature in the header:

```ts
import crypto from "crypto-js"

const generatedSignature = crypto.HmacSHA256(signed_payload, webhookKey).toString();
```
