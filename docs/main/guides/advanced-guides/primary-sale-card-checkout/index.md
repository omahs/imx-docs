# NFT primary sale card checkout

:::caution Feature for managed partners only
This is a feature intended for managed partners. If you are not a managed partner and would like to become one, please reach out to us on our [#dev-discussion channel](https://discord.gg/7URHuYFCN4) on Discord.

If you are a managed partner, your partner success manager needs to set up a commercial partnership with MoonPay for you. Please reach out to them to facilitate this.
:::

We have partnered with MoonPay to enable you to integrate their [NFT Checkout](https://www.moonpay.com/business/nfts) feature so you can build applications that allow your users to purchase NFTs directly on ImmutableX with a credit card - no ETH or other ERC20 token required!
