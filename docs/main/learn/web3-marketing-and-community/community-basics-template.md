<ListAdmonition>
    <ul>
        <li> A basic template that can be used to introduce high level community management principles to your project.</li>
    </ul>
</ListAdmonition>


## **Template**

**Empowerment**

1. List ways that users can become more involved in your project.

Example

- We will provide early users with the cool person role, which enables them to have weekly discussions with the development team

**Incentives**

1. Identify behaviors you want users to take into your ecosystem
2. Come up with incentives for each method

Example

- We want users to trade 1 NFT every 30 days and we will provide them with X tokens for doing this

**Community leadership**

1. Who is the figurehead for your project
2. How often does your community leadership interact with the community?
3. How often does your community leadership produce content that benefits the space?

**Communication cadence**

1. How often do you wish to communicate
2. Which channel will you use
3. Who is communicating

Here's an example template - feel free to adjust it to fit your project. For example, you may wish to have project updates on a weekly basis, or you may commit to updating about a specific item on the roadmap.
