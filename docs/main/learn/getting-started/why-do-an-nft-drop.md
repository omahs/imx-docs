## Introduction

Game studios developing on ImmutableX often ask us about project phasing - whether they should release NFTs before launch, or focus all their efforts on finalizing their game. We have combined our experiences with almost a hundred projects across the protocol to help answer this question with a leading practice guide.

**TL:DR ** The most effective way to phase your project is by releasing an NFT collection in early stage development of your game.


The benefits of releasing NFTs prior to game launch fall into five categories:

1. Market validation
2. User acquisition
3. Technical integration
4. Game loops
5. Time to market

## Market validation

NFT sales are an effective way for emerging projects to validate that there is a market who is interested in your game when development is approaching completion and it is open to players at least in a test environment.

## User acquisition

NFT releases are a powerful user acquisition opportunity, especially in the early days of a playable or test game. We think about user acquisition with NFTs along some key themes:

- _Reward for early adopters:_ Selling NFTs provides an opportunity for early adopters to be rewarded for subsequent game growth, and can attract non player personas as well as players (see [Naavik](https://naavik.co/digest/blockchain-players)). This not only increases your potential audience, but creates a group of holders who are incentivised to drive users and interest to your project. Our recommendation in current market conditions is to release an NFT with a utility linked to game growth or success rather than raw speculation.
- _As a viral onboarding loop:_ Releasing low-value NFTs as airdrops or transfers to players who sign up and complete community-growing actions (referring friends, interacting with posts, etc) is a powerful loop to onboard players and bootstrap early growth. Players holding NFTs not only have an incentive to see the game succeed and have their utility grow, but also have the opportunity to begin trading, which propagates your collection to new users. Since viral loops were so effective, ImmutableX commissioned an open source version for our ecosystem! ([front-end](https://github.com/moontek-io/imx-frontend), [back-end](https://github.com/moontek-io/web3-register-backend)).
- _As community incentives and an alternative to advertising:_ Some projects like Guild of Guardians offered low-value NFTs to new joiners and grew to 250k+ community members at a significantly lower cost of acquisition than advertising. In addition, low-value NFTs and whitelists to higher-value NFTs were awarded for pro-community behaviors to further grow users and strengthen the community. Importantly these were retroactively awarded to avoid abuse.

## Technical integration

Minting and releasing NFTs are the simplest activities to execute on ImmutableX for new developers. By releasing NFTs, you are able to get familiar with ImmutableX technical interactions which de-risks future timelines and opens up opportunities to continue to develop the game and the blockchain elements in parallel. 

## Game loops

Similar to the above, releasing NFTs early in the game's lifecycle allows for experimentation and the creation of novel game loops as the game grows. This opens up the opportunity space for your project, and allows early feedback from users. CyberGalz released avatars and accessories well before their game, and used that period to experiment with crafting and dynamic NFTs using ImmutableX features, creating a novel loop of customisation for Galz that was iterated and refined before the final release to users.

## Time to market

Finally, releasing NFTs early in the game's lifecycle can improve time to market for your project and can provide a strong first mover advantage. The Web3 gaming space is facing unprecedented investment and builders, but very few live projects. This may sometimes be exacerbated by macro sentiment generally reducing speculation. There is a unique opportunity to capture attention with a strategic NFT release tied to a broader game narrative, rather than building in stealth and trying to carve out attention alongside many competitors when market activity grows and/or when more games release. For example, there is significantly more competition when launching smartphone apps today vs launching them when smartphones were first released. BLOCKLORDS, a major game not releasing until 2023, has taken the opportunity to market a rolling cadence of free banner claims, early access redemptions, and NFT sales, all accompanied by compelling pre-gameplay footage and a AAA narrative.

Check out our '[How to design an NFT drop](../designing-an-nft-drop/overview.md)' section. This covers key considerations for designing an NFT drop and also answers common questions including:

- How can I determine the quantity and price for my drop?yarn sta
- Should I do a one off drop or a multiple drop?
- What do I need to know before dropping NFTs?
