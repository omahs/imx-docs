## Introduction

Narrative design has historically been a critical component of game design. Narrative can extend into the whole architecture of the game, from the reason why the game and project exists, to the broader game design, the design of characters and the lore and backstory of its characters and scenarios. It's both the physics and the world building of the game.

Beyond looking backward, the narrative is also about how deep your game could go (forward) - for example the possible actions, scenarios and locations the characters could explore. This is termed as the "possibility space".

## Possibility space and game design

Some game designs actually use "possibility space" interchangeably when referring to a game's narrative. This is how core the idea of possibility space is to the field of game design.

While on the whole, games are getting more realistic and immersive, the right possibility space for a game doesn't necessarily need to be all consuming and be full of depth. The right level of possibility space for a game should suit the game itself. A well-crafted possibility space not only opens the doors, but also constrains a player's actions - within a range that they understand clearly. This may be through physical exploration of the boundaries of the space, or through gaining an understanding of the mechanics by exhausting all possible actions available.

Even when games are in physically restricted worlds, possibility space takes on a non physical space dimension. Multiplayer games like League of Legends repeat the same game over and over again, but it is the element of human randomness that adds to the possibility space, allowing for players to create new narratives every game.

In the simplistic example, the games tic-tac-toe and chess have very similar game mechanics but have very different possibility space for its players and pieces - but nevertheless suited to their specific game. Possibility space essentially creates choice for the player, when the choice is too easy, the fun is taken out of the game. Players stop playing video games because there are no more stories to create, no more possibilities to explore. When the choice is too overwhelming, the game may lose its ability to appeal to a broader set of players, and players may not stay long enough.

## Negative possibility space

Another key concept of game design is "negative possibility space". This is where game designs may build the consumers' expectations up but ultimately underperforms those expectations. An example is where in a game there might be a difficult cliff to jump and climb. It takes the player a long time to figure out how to maneuver their character to work out the right sequence of controller moves, as well as which part of the protruding rocks to step on to get up to the top. (Might take a couple hours to get up there). However once up there, there's nothing found. This is what game designers term negative possibility space. There inherently, the player wanted to find some treasure or at least a coin to collect, or even just a compliment that they did great work, but nothing.

## How do you marry possibility space with Web3?

As the meta shifts towards building Web3 games for fun first and foremost, the idea of possibility space is ever-present. Indeed the best game development practices in Web2 already have this narrative-lead approach to game design. This means that Web3 games should aspire to be more like their Web2 counterparts to this end.

The carrot here for Web3 teams is that the added ability to own, trade and monetize through NFTs opens up many more opportunities than the traditional Web2 game. Game economies now encourage real world trading, in game assets can be transferred across games, and developers can now leverage NFT metadata for endless possibilities. Being a game rather than an art NFT project means that developers can now look back on a history of Web2 narrative design to help build the base for their Web3 project narratives.

In any case, leveraging best practices from both the Web3 world or the game development world, narrative building is the natural precursor for any successful Web3 gaming project - a must have for success.
