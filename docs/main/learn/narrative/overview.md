## Introduction

Narrative is the overarching vision and positioning of a project and its future. It is one of the most important elements of a Web3 project. Narrative design is highly important as it articulates the breadth and depth of a game. This guide is intended to give some generalized advice to help you shape and communicate your project's narrative for your community, whoever they might be.

## What is narrative?

For a Web3 gaming project, narrative typically encapsulates product, tokenomic design, the project as an entity, community, the immediate game design, as well as the "possibility space" and beyond - the sum of all actions players can create. For a lack of better description, the narrative is the investment pitch of the project, the reason the game exists and the reason players should play, all rolled into one.

## Why is narrative important?

A project's narrative is the biggest driver of attention, investment and outcomes. Potential customers need to feel like a project has a high likelihood of being delivered, that it is differentiated from other projects, and it will be the 'next big thing'. In Web3 where the final game product can lag marketing and NFTs, this is uniquely critical.

Internally, the narrative defines a single driving force for the project which informs the role of each team member. A powerful narrative sells the dream that the community (literally) buys into, creating a strong brand identity and an army of evangelists in the community.

Many of the most commercially successful Web3 gaming projects have shipped far less than their live competitors but achieve stronger community sentiment and commercial results by fully controlling this narrative.

## How do you start developing your narrative?

There are a number of ways to start your narrative creation process. Chances are you already know elements of this. Some of the reasons why you started the project in the first place is probably part of it (we'll go into sub-narratives). The following articles will provide a sample framework that you can use as a base to craft your own Web3 narrative.
