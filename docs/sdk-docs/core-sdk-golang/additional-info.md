# Additional info

## Contract requests

Immutable X is built as a ZK-rollup in partnership with StarkWare. We chose ZK-rollups because it is the only L2 scaling solution that has the same security guarantees as layer 1 Ethereum. The upshot of this is that you can mint or trade NFTs on Immutable X with zero gas costs whilst not compromising on security -- the first true “layer 2” for NFTs on Ethereum.

The Core SDK provides interfaces for all smart contracts required to interact with the Immutable X platform.

[See all smart contracts available in the Core SDK](#smart-contract-autogeneration)

```go
// This example is only to demonstrate using the generated smart contract clients
// We recommend using the workflows to deposit NFT
func DepositNft(l1signer signers.L1Signer, starkKey, assetType, vaultID, tokenID *big.Int) {
   cfg := config.GetConfig(config.Sandbox, "alchemy api key")
   client, err := ethclient.Dial(cfg.EthereumClientEndpoint)
   if err != nil {
      log.Panic(err)
   }
   defer client.Close()

   ethAddress := ethcommon.HexToAddress(l1signer.GetAddress())
   auth := &bind.TransactOpts{
      From: ethAddress,
      Signer: func(address ethcommon.Address, tx *types.Transaction) (*types.Transaction, error) {
         if address != ethAddress {
            return nil, bind.ErrNotAuthorized
         }
         return l1signer.SignTx(tx)
      },
      Context: context.Background(),
   }

   core, err := contracts.NewCore(ethcommon.HexToAddress(cfg.StarkContractAddress), client)
   transaction, err := core.DepositNft(auth, starkKey, assetType, vaultID, tokenID)
   log.Println("transaction hash:", transaction.Hash())
}
```


## Autogenerated code

Parts of the Core SDK are automagically generated.

### API autogenerated code

We use OpenAPI (formally known as Swagger) to auto-generate the API clients that connect to the public APIs.
The OpenAPI spec is retrieved from https://api.x.immutable.com/openapi and also saved in the repo.

### Smart contract autogeneration

The Immutable Solidity contracts can be found in the `contracts` folder. Contract bindings in Golang are generated using [abigen](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/dapp/native-bindings#abigen-go-binding-generator).

#### Core

The Core contract is Immutable's main interface with the Ethereum blockchain, based on [StarkEx](https://docs.starkware.co/starkex-v4).

[View contract](https://github.com/immutable/imx-core-sdk-golang/tree/main/contracts/Core.sol)

#### Registration

The Registration contract is a proxy smart contract for the Core contract that combines transactions related to onchain registration, deposits and withdrawals. When a user who is not registered onchain attempts to perform a deposit or a withdrawal, the Registration combines requests to the Core contract in order to register the user first. Users who are not registered onchain are not able to perform a deposit or withdrawal.

For example, instead of making subsequent transaction requests to the Core contract, i.e. `registerUser` and `depositNft`, a single transaction request can be made to the proxy Registration contract - `registerAndWithdrawNft`.

#### IERC721

Standard interface for interacting with ERC721 contracts, taken from [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721).
