| Sandbox     | The default test network (currently, it is Goërli)  |
| Mainnet     | Ethereum network    | 

```csharp
using Imx.Sdk;

try
{
    Client client = new Client(new Config()
    {
        Environment = EnvironmentSelector.Sandbox
    });
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error message: " + e.Message);
    Console.WriteLine(e.StackTrace);
