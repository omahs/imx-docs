# Overview

The Immutable Core SDK provides convenient access to Immutable's APIs and smart contracts to help projects build better web3 games and marketplaces.

Currently, our SDK supports interactions with our application-specific rollup based on StarkWare's StarkEx. In future, we'll be adding StarkNet support across our platform.

## Documentation

See our [developer documentation](https://docs.x.immutable.com) for information on building on Immutable X.

See our [API reference](https://docs.x.immutable.com/reference) for more information on our APIs.
