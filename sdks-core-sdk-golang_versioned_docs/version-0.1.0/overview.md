# Overview

:::danger The Golang SDK Interface is under active development and hasn't hit v1.0 yet.

Its public interface shouldn't be considered final, and we may need to release breaking changes as we push towards v1.0.
:::

The Immutable Core SDK Golang provides convenient access to the Immutable X API and Ethereum contract methods for applications written on the Immutable X platform.

Currently, our SDK supports interactions with our application-specific rollup based on StarkWare's [StarkEx](https://starkware.co/starkex/). In the future, we'll be adding [StarkNet](https://starknet.io/) support across our platform.


## Documentation

See the [Developer guides](https://docs.x.immutable.com) for information on building on Immutable X.

See the [API reference documentation](https://docs.x.immutable.com/reference) for more information on our API's.
